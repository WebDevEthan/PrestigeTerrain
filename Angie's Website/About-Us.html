                        <p class="about-us-section2-paragraph-text right-paragraph">At the height of Covid in 2020, we moved our family from Oregon to Michigan to be close to family. We built our house during that time, and we enjoyed the experience, so I decided to get my residential builders license and start building homes at some point. In the meantime, this business was started so that we can collectively use our experiences and professional training to provide excellent services to those that need them. This business is also a way for me to be a stay-at-home mom and provide an income for our family. Our end goal is to hand our children an investment for their future. </p>
